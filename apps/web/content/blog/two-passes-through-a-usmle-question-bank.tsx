    <p>
      Almost every medical student hears the same advice about question banks: do two passes. It is
      easy to agree with and hard to picture. With thousands of questions to get through before
      test day, most people cannot see how one pass fits into a busy schedule, let alone two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is planning. Two passes only work when you split them into two phases with two
      different jobs, and when you turn each phase into a small, fixed number of questions per day.
      This guide gives you the arithmetic, a calendar you can copy, and a way to review without
      falling behind. It applies to any question bank, and to{' '}
      <Link href="/usmle-step-1-question-bank">Step 1</Link>,{' '}
      <Link href="/usmle-step-2-question-bank">Step 2 CK</Link> and{' '}
      <Link href="/usmle-step-3-question-bank">Step 3</Link> alike.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.why} />
    <p>
      A single pass tells you what you do not know. A second pass is where you fix it. The first
      time through, you meet most of the material cold, so your score mostly reflects exposure. The
      second time, you are checking whether the first pass actually stuck, and that is a much better
      picture of how ready you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other reason is memory. Seeing a concept once, even with a good explanation, fades within
      days. Seeing it again after a gap, especially a gap you have to work to bridge, is what moves
      it into long-term memory. Two passes are a rough, manual version of spaced repetition.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.first} />
    <p>
      Pass one happens during coursework, well before dedicated study begins. Its job is learning,
      not testing. Use the bank as a companion to what you are already studying in class.
    </p>
    <h3>Turn each topic block into a daily number</h3>
    <p>
      When you start a new topic in class, check how many questions the bank has for that subject
      or system, then divide by the days in the block:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>questions in the topic ÷ days in the block = questions to do each day</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a 21-day biochemistry block has 210 questions available, that is 10 questions a day. For
      most topics the answer lands around 8 to 12 questions daily, which is a small enough habit to
      survive exam weeks. Work ahead on light days so that a heavy day does not break the streak.
    </p>
    <h3>How to do pass one</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Use untimed, tutor-style practice.</strong> You want the explanation right after
        each answer, while the question is still in your head.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do not chase your score.</strong> Early accuracy is not a prediction of anything.
        Accuracy matters in pass two.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stay in topic order.</strong> Practicing the system you just studied in class
        reinforces it while it is fresh.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Note what you miss by concept.</strong> A pattern of misses in one area is worth
        more than any single wrong answer.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <H2 section={S.second} />
    <p>
      Pass two starts when dedicated study begins. Now the goal changes: you are practicing under
      realistic conditions and finding what is still weak.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Reset your statistics if your bank allows it.</strong> A clean slate makes your
        dedicated-period accuracy an honest number instead of one blended with coursework guesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Count your study days.</strong> Do not include off days. Only days you will really
        work belong in the count.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Divide the total questions by those days.</strong> That is your daily quota.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protect the quota.</strong> When review runs long, do not cut questions. Cut review
        time on easy items instead (more on that below).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <H2 section={S.calc} />
    <p>
      The formula is <strong>total questions ÷ study days = questions per day</strong>. The table
      uses an example bank of 3,600 questions and six study days a week. Swap in your own bank size
      and schedule.
    </p>
    <ComparisonTable
      caption="Daily questions needed for a full second pass (example bank of 3,600 questions)"

        { key: 'days', label: 'Study days (6 a week)' },
        { key: 'perDay', label: 'Questions per day' },
        { key: 'time', label: 'Time answering per day at 90 seconds each' },
      ]}
      rows={[

        { id: 'w6', cells: { length: '6 weeks', days: '36', perDay: '100', time: 'About 2.5 hours' } },
        { id: 'w8', cells: { length: '8 weeks', days: '48', perDay: '75', time: 'About 1.9 hours' } },
        { id: 'w10', cells: { length: '10 weeks', days: '60', perDay: '60', time: 'About 1.5 hours' } },
      ]}
      footnote="Time answering only. Reviewing explanations usually takes as long again, so budget for both."
    />
    <p>
      This table is the real lesson. If you only have four weeks, a full second pass means 150
      questions a day and a working day that is mostly questions. Knowing that early lets you choose
      a different plan before you are behind. It also tells you the latest date you can start.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.timing} />
    <p>
      In pass one you practiced untimed. In pass two, move to timed, mixed blocks so you are training
      the conditions you will face on test day.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Timed.</strong> Step 1 and Step 2 CK run in 60-minute blocks of up to 40 questions,
        which is about 90 seconds a question. Practicing at that pace builds the habit of moving
        on. Step 3 uses different block sizes, so check USMLE.org for the current layout.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Random or mixed.</strong> The exam does not sort questions by system, so your
        practice should not either. Mixing makes you identify the topic, not just recall it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Full-length blocks.</strong> Work up to complete blocks to build stamina. The exam
        strings several of them together in one day.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <H2 section={S.review} />
    <p>
      Most people fall behind on review, not on questions. If you spend 90 seconds on each
      explanation in a 40-question block, that is an hour before you have even read anything in
      depth. Reviewing everything equally does not scale, so triage it.
    </p>
    <ComparisonTable

        { key: 'result', label: 'What happened' },

          },
        },
      ]}
      footnote="Time you save on the last two rows pays for the first."
    />
    <p>
      The point is to keep your question count constant and change how long each explanation gets.
      Cutting your daily quota to fit review is the mistake that breaks a second pass.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.short} />
    <p>
      Not everyone has the weeks for a full second pass. If that is you, do one complete pass, then
      redo only the questions you missed or guessed. You will skip some material you would have
      benefited from, but you will spend your limited time on your weakest areas, which is where the
      points are.
    </p>
    <p>
      That partial pass is a version of what an adaptive question bank does automatically, which is
      the next section.
    </p>

    <H2 section={S.engine} />
    <p>
      Two passes are a manual workaround for a limitation of fixed-order question banks: the bank
      does not remember what you missed, so you have to. You calculate quotas, track weak concepts
      yourself, decide what to redo, and remember to redo it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MedPrep Institute is built to take that work off you. When you miss a question, the adaptive
      engine flags the underlying concept and brings you variations on it through spaced repetition
      over the following days, instead of just moving on. Your weakest disciplines are prioritized
      automatically, and you can restrict practice to one system, or leave it wide open.

      MedPrep works best alongside the plan above, not instead of it. The daily-quota habit gives
      you structure, and the adaptive engine makes sure the time you put in goes to the concepts
      that need it. If you are short on time, it is also the closest thing to a targeted second pass
      that runs itself.

    <H2 section={S.faq} />
    <h3>Do I really need two passes through a question bank?</h3>
    <p>
      No, but it is a reliable way to make sure the first pass sticks. If your time is limited, one
      full pass plus a focused second pass over what you missed captures most of the benefit.
    </p>
    <h3>When should I start the first pass?</h3>
    <p>
      Many students start in their pre-clinical years, alongside classes, in untimed topic mode.
      Starting earlier spreads the work over a longer period, so each day is small. Pick a plan
      length that matches when you will actually use it.
    </p>
    <h3>How many questions should I do a day?</h3>
    <p>
      Divide the total number of questions by your real study days. During coursework that is often
      around 8 to 12 a day. During dedicated study it is often between 60 and 120, depending on how
      many weeks you have.
    </p>
    <h3>Should I do timed or untimed questions?</h3>
    <p>
      Untimed while you are learning, timed and mixed during dedicated study. The exam is timed and
      unsorted, so your final weeks of practice should be too.
    </p>
    <h3>How long should I spend reviewing explanations?</h3>
    <p>
      Match it to the question. Read missed questions you should have known in full, treat guesses
      as misses, and only skim the ones you got right with confidence. Do not shorten your daily
      quota to make room for review.
    </p>
    <h3>Is Step 1 still worth this much effort now that it is pass/fail?</h3>
    <p>
      Step 1 is reported as pass/fail, so a comfortable margin matters more than a high score. The
      same planning still applies, and the concepts you learn carry into Step 2 CK, where a numeric
      score is still reported.
    </p>
    <h3>Does MedPrep Institute replace a second pass?</h3>
    <p>
      For many students it covers the point of one. Missed concepts return on a spaced schedule from
      different angles, so you revisit what you struggle with without re-running everything. It does
      not include official self-assessment exams, so use those separately to check readiness.
